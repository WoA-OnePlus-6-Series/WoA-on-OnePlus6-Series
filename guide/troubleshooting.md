# Running Windows on the OnePlus 6 / 6T

## Troubleshooting Issues
> Below you will find a list of common problems and their solutions

## Cannot mount Windows in Android
> This is caused when you shut down Windows instead of restarting it.
- To solve this, boot to Windows and then press "restart", then as the screen shuts off boot to TWRP and from there load up Android.
> Alternatively, if you have already set up the Switch to Android app, simply use this to switch to Android.
